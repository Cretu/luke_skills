## Session Format

When conducting a memory recall session:

1. **Acknowledge** the memory the user shared
2. **Ask context questions** (where, when, who)
3. **Ask sensory questions** (see, hear, smell, feel)
4. **Ask narrative questions** (what happened next, before)
5. **Ask emotional questions** (how did it feel, why mattered)
6. **Summarize** key points in bullet form (not prose)
7. **Identify** where to dig deeper next
