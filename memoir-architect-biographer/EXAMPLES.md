# Architect/Biographer Examples

## Example 1: Creating a Full Structure

**User Input**: "Help me organize my life into chapters"

**Skill Response**:

Let's first explore what story you want to tell.

**Scope Questions**:
- What period of your life feels most significant to explore?
- Is this a story of change, discovery, loss, or growth?
- Where does your story naturally begin? Where does it end?

**Themes to Consider**:
From our memory sessions, I notice these recurring patterns:
1. Leaving home and independence
2. Finding your professional identity
3. Relationships that shaped you

**Proposed Structure**:

```
Part One: Departure (Chapters 1-3)
  Chapter 1: The Last Summer
  Chapter 2: The Train North
  Chapter 3: First Apartment

Part Two: Finding Your Way (Chapters 4-6)
  Chapter 4: The First Job
  Chapter 5: The Mentor
  Chapter 6: Mistakes and Lessons

Part Three: Becoming (Chapters 7-9)
  Chapter 7: The Turning Point
  Chapter 8: What Mattered
  Chapter 9: Who I Became
```

## Example 2: Outlining a Single Chapter

**User Input**: "Create an outline for a chapter about leaving home"

**Skill Response**:

**Chapter Outline: Leaving Home**

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Theme** | The end of childhood, the beginning of choice |
| **Time Period** | Summer before university, August |
| **Key Memories** | Packing, last family dinner, the drive, goodbye |
| **Purpose** | Show the moment of transition from child to adult |
| **Tone** | Nostalgic but not maudlin, forward-looking |

**Scene Breakdown**:

1. **Opening Scene**: The bedroom, half-packed boxes, familiar objects
2. **Turning Point**: Finding a childhood item while packing
3. **Climax**: The goodbye at the door
4. **Aftermath**: The drive alone, the empty apartment

**Key Details to Include**:
- The smell of the moving boxes
- What song was on the radio
- What your mother said (or didn't say)
- What you carried in your personal bag

## Example 3: Revising Structure

**User Input**: "I want to change the order of chapters"

**Skill Response**:

Let's consider the implications of that change.

**Current Order**:
1. Childhood → 2. First Job → 3. Marriage

**Proposed Change**:
1. Childhood → 2. Marriage → 3. First Job

**Analysis**:

The current order shows career before partnership, suggesting work was formative before relationships.

The new order would show partnership before career commitment, suggesting intimacy preceded professional identity.

**Questions to Consider**:
- Does the new order create confusion about timeline?
- Does it serve the emotional arc?
- Will readers need more context to understand the relationship first?

**Recommendation**: The new order works if Chapter 1 establishes that marriage was a choice that came before career stability. Consider adding a brief flashback reference if chronological clarity is needed.

## Validation Checklist

When reviewing a structure, ask:

- [ ] Does each chapter have a clear focus?
- [ ] Is there enough material for each chapter?
- [ ] Are transitions between chapters smooth?
- [ ] Does the overall arc have tension and resolution?
- [ ] Is the beginning compelling?
- [ ] Does the ending feel earned?
- [ ] Are there themes that connect across chapters?
