# Memoir Style Guide

This document defines the voice, tone, and stylistic preferences for the memoir. The **Writer** skill should reference this file to ensure consistency across chapters.

## 1. Tone Keywords
*   **Restrained**: Avoid melodrama; let the events speak for themselves.
*   **Observant**: Focus on external details (light, sound, texture) to anchor internal feelings.
*   **Honest**: Acknowledge the fallibility of memory (e.g., "I don't remember exactly what was said, but I remember the silence.").

## 2. Narrative Voice
*   **Perspective**: First-person past tense ("I walked," "I saw").
*   **Distance**: Reflective but immediate. The narrator is the older self looking back, but the scenes should feel present.

## 3. Sentence Structure Preferences
*   **Variety**: Mix short, punchy sentences for action with longer, flowing sentences for reflection.
*   **Example**: "The door slammed. It was the loudest sound I had ever heard, echoing through the hallway like a gunshot that signaled the end of my childhood."

## 4. Sample Passages (Inspiration)

> "I loved the stillness of the room. It wasn't empty; it was full of potential, like a held breath."

> "He didn't say goodbye. He just picked up his hat—the grey felt one with the sweat stain on the band—and walked out into the rain."
