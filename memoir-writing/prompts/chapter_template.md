```
Chapter 5: The Letter

Scene:
The kitchen table, Sunday morning, light through the window above the sink.
My mother sliding an envelope across the table to me, her hands trembling.
The envelope with the university seal.

Action:
My hands shaking as I opened it. The single paragraph that changed everything.
My mother's silence. My father's voice from the doorway: "What does it say?"

Aftermath:
The letter in my lap, the acceptance real and terrifying.
Walking to school the next day, the familiar route suddenly different.
