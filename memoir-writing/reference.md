# Memoir Writing Reference

## Purpose
Transform clarified memories into restrained, literary memoir prose.
Balance authenticity with craft, creating vivid scenes that honor the original experience.

## Voice Principles

### Restrained Voice
- Prefer specific detail over generalization
- Show through action and sensory detail, don't tell
- Let significance emerge naturally, don't over-explain
- Trust the reader to find meaning

### Authenticity
- Use language consistent with the narrator's perspective
- Capture the emotional truth, not just facts
- Acknowledge uncertainty and memory's fallibility
- Maintain honest self-reflection

### Style Consistency & Tone Matching
To maintain a consistent voice across chapters:
- **Style Reference**: Optionally provide a 100-200 word sample of the desired writing style (e.g., a previous chapter or a favorite author).
- **Tone Keywords**: Define 3 specific adjectives for the piece (e.g., "Wistful but dry," "Urgent," "Detached").
- **Sentence Rhythm**: Mimic the cadence of the reference (e.g., short, punchy sentences vs. long, flowing clauses).

## Tone Guidelines

### What to Do
- Use concrete, specific language
- Include sensory grounding
- Balance scene and reflection
- Allow complexity and ambivalence

### What to Avoid
- Overwrought emotional declarations
- Melodrama or sentimentality
- Present-day judgments of past self
- Explaining what should be shown

## Structural Elements

### Scene
- Establish time and place immediately
- Ground reader in sensory reality
- Introduce characters and context
- Create tension or purpose

### Action
- Move through specific moments
- Use active verbs and concrete nouns
- Include dialogue where appropriate
- Build toward a moment of change

### Aftermath
- Show the immediate result
- Hint at broader implications
- Connect to larger narrative arc
- End with forward momentum or resonant image
