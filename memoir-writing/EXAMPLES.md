# Memoir Writing Examples

## Example 1: Childhood Scene

**Input (Memory Notes)**:
- Age 7 or 8
- Learning to ride bicycle
- Concrete driveway
- Father running behind holding seat
- The moment of balance, then falling
- Scraped knee, but proud

**Draft**:

The Schwinn was too big for me, its blue frame towering above my handlebars. My father ran behind, one hand on the seat, the other hovering at the level of my shoulders, ready to catch what he could not prevent.

"Keep your eyes forward," he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice even as my knuckles whitened on the grip.

The driveway stretched ahead, endless, bordered by the hydrangeas my mother had planted the summer before. I felt the bike begin to wobble—then, impossibly, steady. My father's hand was gone. I didn't realize it until I had already traveled twenty feet, twenty feet of balance I had found myself.

When I turned, he was standing where he had always been, arms crossed, pretending he had never let go.

I rode back toward him, and this time I did not fall. But I told myself I would never tell him that I knew.

## Example 2: Reflection Passage

**Input (Memory Notes)**:
- Leaving home for first time
- University dormitory
- Mother helped unpack
- When she left, room felt enormous
- First night alone in unfamiliar city

**Draft**:

My mother unpacked my shirts as though she was moving in. She folded them the way she always had, sleeves tucked, collars straight, and placed them in the dresser with the care of someone building a life.

I stood in the doorway and watched her, and I did not help.

She did not look at me when she finished. She simply closed the last drawer, ran her palm once over the top of the dresser, and said, "I think that's everything."

Then she walked past me, out into the hall, and I followed her to the door of the dormitory. She hugged me there, quickly, the way she always did in public—as though displays of affection were currency she was unwilling to spend.

"Call me when you get settled," she said.

And then she was walking toward the stairs, and I was watching her go, and I realized that I could not remember the last time I had watched her leave without turning away first.

The room was quiet after she left. I sat on the bed—my bed, I corrected myself—and looked at the walls, at the desk, at the window that looked out onto a lawn I had never seen before, in a city where no one knew my name.

## Example 3: Dialogue-Heavy Scene

**Input (Memory Notes)**:
- Conversation with grandmother
- Kitchen table, afternoon light
- She told me about her childhood
- First time she shared these stories
- Specific phrase I remember

**Draft**:

"You never told me that before," I said.

She poured more tea into my cup without asking if I wanted it. "You never asked."

The afternoon light came through the window above the sink and caught the silver in her hair, made it glow white. Outside, the neighbors were mowing their lawn. The sound was distant, as though it came from another world.

"What else didn't I ask?"

She considered this. She always considered things—her answers never came quickly, and when they came, they were precise.

"There are things I have told no one," she said. "Not because I wanted to keep them, but because no one wanted to hear them."

"Do you want me to hear them?"

She looked at me then, and I saw something in her eyes that I had not seen before—not sadness, exactly, but the weight of things unsaid.

"Perhaps," she said. "Perhaps I do."

## Style Comparison

### Weak (What to Avoid)

> I was so nervous when I walked into the classroom. I looked around and saw all these familiar faces staring at me. I felt like everyone was judging me. I remember feeling scared and excited at the same time, a mixture of emotions that was overwhelming. This moment was very significant because it changed my life forever.

### Strong (What to Aim For)

> The classroom smelled of floor wax and chalk dust. Twenty-three faces turned toward me—friends I had known for years, suddenly unfamiliar. I found my seat by the window and sat down, and for the rest of the period I looked at the back of Jennifer Morrison's head, thinking about what came next.
